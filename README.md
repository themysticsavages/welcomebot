## Information

WelcomeBot is a specialized per-server welcome bot which can send a custom welcome message on a user join. In addition to custom messages, you can also use different types of messages. This bot won't be updated as much, especially considering that this creates welcome messages only.

## How do I use this?

WelcomeBot can create welcome messages using JSON, since handling configurations otherwise would be slightly harder to do. You can get a few templates using `g?confighelp` in Discord. You'll see this:

<sub>(Sorry if it's a bit confusing)</sub>

You can basically copy-paste the templates, edit them, and run them with `g?config`. Since administrators can run this only, I trust you not to run this more than once. If you need to edit your message, run `g?unconfig`.
